# Description

This project is a RESTful web API that maintains a database of GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifier) and associated metadata. It provides CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
It is written in Python. It utilizes Tornado web framework for the RESTful interface and MongoDB for the database.
It also utilizes a hash table as a temporary cache.

To run the program, run:
python3 app.py
It will prompt you for a username and password to connect to the cloud MongoDB (This is in the email I sent).
If the terminal says success, you can run example.py in another terminal or send the server requests using a client like curl.
